Rigid transforms: rotation, translation, reflection  

<br>
Write the shape and its translation using prime symbol ' [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)](<a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)</a>

<br>
Three pieces of information are needed to rotate a shape:  

<br>the centre of rotation  
<br>the angle of rotation  
<br>the direction of rotation  


<br>
In reflection A to A' will be perpendicular to line of reflection. To describe a reflection on a grid, the equation of the mirror line is needed. E.g reflect in X= -1  

<br>
Column vectors are used to describe translations. 


<br>
Two pieces of information are needed to enlarge a shape:  

<br>the scale factor  
<br>the centre of enlargement - can be outside shape  


<br>
Congruent shape are same size and shape. One can cover the other via rigid transforms. Can include reflection.  

<br>Triangle congruent tests: SSS SAS ASA RHS  


<br>
Similar shapes need rigid and non rigid transforms to cover each other.

<br>Similar have corresponding angles the same,  and corresponding sides same scale factor.  
<br>Two triangles are similar if the angles are the same size or the corresponding sides are in the same ratio. Either of these conditions will prove two triangles are similar.  


<br><br>
<br>A side of a triangle must be:

<br>Shorter than the sum of the other sides
<br>Longer than the difference between the other two sides

These concepts are fundamental to success in higher math classes such as Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. We will review operations with whole numbers, then move on to learn how to perform operations with integers, fractions, and decimals. We will wrap up our course by learning how to find the mean, median, and mode for a group of numbers, along with how to convert between various units of measurement.

 <br><br>Not really sure to what extent these are useful, but here they are. Probably better to look them up as needed for specific problems, apart from some easy ones like 9, 3, 4<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 2 if the number is even. This means the final digit of the number ends with a (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the number's digits is divisible by 3
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 4 if the final two digits of the number form a number that is divisible by 4
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 5 if the final digit is a 0 or a 5
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3
<br><br>
<br>We start by removing the final digit from the number, double the number and subtract it away from the shortened original number
<br>If the number formed is a 0 or a number that is divisible by 7, the original number is divisible by 7. We can repeat the process as needed
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 8 if the final three digits of the number form a number that is divisible by 8
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of the number's digits is divisible by 9
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 10 if the final digit is a 0
<br><br>
<br>Form the sum of the digits in the odd places and subtract away the sum of the digits in the even places
<br>The odd places refer to the 1st digit, 3rd digit, 5th digit, and so on
<br>The even places refer to the 2nd digit, 4th digit, 6th digit, and so on
<br>Note, we can count our digits starting from right to left or left to right. This can result in a sign difference, which is not important.
<br>If the result is a 0 or a number that is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11
<br><br>
<br>A number is divisible by 12 if the number is divisible by both 3 and 4

 <br>
<br>If we are working with a negative number raised to a power, the base does not include the negative part unless we use parentheses

<br>-22&nbsp;≠ (-2)


<br>-2 is the same as -1 x 2&nbsp; so from the order of operations...

<br>-2&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1 x 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1 x 4&nbsp;=&nbsp;-4


<br>(-2) has the negative in the base

<br>(-2)  = (1 x -2)  = -2 x -2 = 4


<br><br>
<br>When the base is (-), and enclosed inside of parentheses:

<br>The result is (+) if the exponent is even
<br>The result is (-) if the exponent is odd


<br>When the base is (-), and not enclosed inside of parentheses:

<br>The result is always (-)

<br>
A linear equation in two variables is a <a data-href="Linear equations" href="\1-secondary\1-1-algebra-i\linear-equations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Linear equations</a> with two variable. The solution/s are written as an ordered pair.

<br>
An ordered pair is written (a, b) where a is the x coordinate and b is the y coordinate (see graphing).

<br>
We tend to find a given number of ordered pair solutions so we can graph the result. 

<br>
To create a table we plug in one value and then solve for the other.

<br>
Cartesian co-ord plane has 4 quadrants, labelled I to IV starting top right and going anti-clockwise.

<br>I is (+, +)
<br>II is (-, +)
<br>III is (-, -)
<br>IV is (+, -)
<br>Origin is (0, 0)


<br><br><br>
<br>
Why and how to use slope-intercept form. 

<br>y = mx + b
<br>Difficult to find a table of ordered pairs, so we set x=0, get the y-intercept and the slope, which is enough to graph the line.


<br>
Why and how to use point-slope form.

<br>y - b = m(x - a)
<br>When we know a slope and one point (a, b)


<br>
Standard form

<br>ax + by = c or similar (defs. vary)
<br>Lets us find x &amp; y intercepts then graph
<br>We can convert to std form by getting x any onto one side of the equation


<br><br>
<br>Solve for y (if an inequality remember when to reverse the sign, if just x or y it's a vertical or horizontal line)
<br>Put into slope-intercept form y = mx + b
<br>For an equality simply plot y-intercept (0, b) and another point or two on the slope.
<br>For an inequality make a dashed line for strict and a solid line for ≤ ≥
<br>Shade or indicate the solution space, above the line for &gt; ≥ below for &lt;  ≤
<br><br><br>
Greene Math: When we have a linear equation in two variables, there are an infinite number of solutions. This means there are an unlimited number of (x,y) ordered pairs that will satisfy the equation.

 Marsh: Counting all the real numbers that fit as values? Including all the decimals? Up to now all the answers to test problems have been been integers or fractions (rational numbers).

 D--p: yes
 If you have a 2-variable linear equation, you can always rearrange it to look like y=a*x+b for some a,b . Then, you can choose any real number, rational or irrational, for x, slot it into that formula, and get a corresponding value for y.
 So there’s an infinite (in the sense of, one for every real number) number of possibilities for x; for each of those there’s a corresponding real y, so there is an infinite number of (x,y) pairs
 You can certainly restrict yourself to only integer or rational values, and maybe that’s the right thing to do (eg if the linear equation in question relates discrete quantities like “number of people”) but the linear equation itself will happily work with any real values
 (In fact you can generalise it to work with complex values or vector values or even weirder stuff like “elements of the set of functions defined on a specified range” - when you do that you’re into the field of linear algebra, but it all comes from the same root)
Or there’s the geometric interpretation: every 2-variable linear equation describes a line in 2-d space - the line of the graph of y=a*x+b as obtained above. Each point on that line corresponds to an ordered (x,y) pair. Just as there’s an infinite number of points on the line, there’s an infinite number of such ordered pairs.
Similarly: it’s reasonable in certain contexts to draw the line on squared paper and only pay attention to where it intersects the grid, corresponding to integer x and y. But you don’t necessarily have to do that; the line itself is infinite in extent and infinitely divisible.


<br><br>
Marsh: Quick question maths. When graphing an inequality, what's the pen and paper way to shade the right region? Like, if you were in an exam?

H----e: I recall teachers saying it doesn't matter but you do have to provide a key and get it the right way round there.


&nbsp;D--p: I was taught that you hatched the line on the&nbsp;opposite&nbsp;side to that indicated by the inequality, because if you have multiple inequalities then it gets to be a real mess otherwise
&nbsp;“D--p_inequalities_diagram.jpg” could not be found.
&nbsp;(Image: Friend's graph of 3 inequalities on one graph)
&nbsp;Doing linear programming problems is a right pain otherwise
&nbsp;
&nbsp;There’s a whole little subfield called “linear programming” or “linear optimization” where you’re given a set of constraints like this and you have to find the region where they’re all satisfied (the triangle above), and then optimize something within that region

<br><br>Errors I often make

<br>When multiplying out brackets, ensure the sign of the product/s is correct.
<br>When moving terms across the equals sign, ensure the sign correctly reflects how you removed the term from the original side. E.g "+2" moved across the equals becomes "-2" because it was subtracted from the original side. Think: I'm not moving +2 across; I'm subtracting it from each side.

<br>
<br>We call an equation linear if every term is either a constant or a product of a constant and the first power of a single variable.
<br>Why we don't use x as the sign for multiplication; what we do instead; dots, parentheses, proximity.
<br>Define term (a constant, or a variable and coefficient) and expression (terms separated by + or -)
<br>Explain the various coefficients in for example 4xy (4 is c of xy; 4x is c of y; x is c of 4y )
<br>Define like terms (same variable raised to the same power)
<br>Combine like terms by keeping variables the same and performing operations on coefficients
<br>Simplify an expression by removing parentheses and combining like terms
<br>Define equation (a statement two algebraic expressions are equal; always&nbsp;includes the = symbol)
<br>Test a solution for a variable in an equation by simple substitution (plug it in, see if it gives true result)
<br>Understand the addition property of equality (we can add or subtract a value from both sides of an equation without changing the solution)

<br>Additive inverse property any number plus its negative is zero
<br>Additive identity of zero any number plus zero is unchanged.


<br>In a simple equation solvable by addition and subtraction, isolate a variable by inverse operations (add or subtract from both sides until you get x = number)
<br>Understand the multiplicative property of equality (we can mult or div both sides by a non-zero value without changing the solution)
<br>Multiplicative identity property of 1 any number x1 is unchanged
<br>Multiplicative invers property any non-zero number, expressed as fraction, x its reciprocal, is 1
<br>In a simple equation solvable by mult and div, isolate a variable by inverse operations
<br>Solve linear equations in one variable with a 4 step process.
<br>Spot conditional (normal solvable, inc. 1y = 0), identity (0y = 0 but not 1y = 0; solution is any real number {ℝ} ) and contradiction (no solution is true {∅} ) equations.
<br>Define ratio, rate and proportion.
<br>! I dunno about this. More usually seems to need simplification with LCD!  Solve proportion equations by starting with cross multiplication then the four steps.
<br><br>Success
This is a rubicon. It's the precise moment school maths left me behind, and I had no idea what was going on from here to the GCSE exams. Doing this and enjoying it brought a tear to my eye.
<br>Fourish step process:<br>
<br>If it's a word or application problem, find what is being asked and assign the unknown quantity a variable.
<br>If it's a proportion equation, one fraction each side, cross multiply.
<br>
<br>Simplify both sides so far as possible
<br>
<br>Remove brackets by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Properties of multiplication" data-href="Properties of multiplication" href="\1-secondary\1-0-pre-algebra\properties-of-multiplication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">distributive property of multiplication</a>
<br>When we encounter an equation with fractions and parentheses are involved, we want to remove parentheses before we clear our fractions
<br>Q: decimals clear before or after brackets? A: before but don't multiply up the bracket contents.
<br>Collect like terms
<br>
<br>Isolate the variable term(s) on one side, usually left, using addition/subtraction (addition property of equality, additive inverse property)
<br>Isolate the variable using multiplication and division
<br>Check the answer by substituting the variable in the original equation. This matters it's where you may find div by zero etc. contradictions.

A number is called a solution for the equation involving one variable if substituting this number for the variable makes the equation true. The set of all solutions for the equation is called its solution set. To solve the equation means to find its solution set.
<br>
Equations are equivalent if they have the same solutions sets.
<br><br>
A linear equation is an equation in which each term is either a numerical constant or the product of a numerical constant and the first power of a single variable.
<br>
If the equation looks like 0 = 4 or something equally wrong, then it is false for all x. There are no solutions: the set of solutions is empty, or ∅. 
If the equation looks like 0 = 0, then it is true for all x. Every real number is a solution: the set of solutions is the set of all reals, or ℝ.
<br><br>
While the word formula has no traditional formal definition, this will be our word of choice for equations in more than one variable.
<br>
We say that a formula involving a variable y is solved for y if it is written in the form y = expression where one side of the equation is just y, and the expression on the other side does not contain y at all.

<br>Solve linear inequalities in one variable

<br>Remember when to reverse the inequality (mult or divide by same negative number)


<br>Test solutions (above and below range)
<br>Write solutions in range notation
<br>Graph solutions on number line
<br>

A linear inequality is an inequality relation applied to two linear expressions. There are four types of linear inequalities corresponding to the four types of inequality relations:
x &lt; y, x &gt; y, x ≼ y, and x ≽ y.
We say that a number is a solution for the given inequality in variable x if substituting that number for x makes the inequality true. The collection of all such numbers forms the solution set for the inequality.


<br>
(Interval Notation). The interval notation (a, b) describes the set of all real numbers between a and b. When we want to include the endpoints, we use square brackets: [a, b]. When we want the interval to extend indefinitely, we use the infinity sign: (a, ∞).
<br>
Inequalities are equivalent if they have the same solution sets. 
<br>
THEOREM (Addition Property for Inequalities). Adding the same number on both sides of an inequality produces an equivalent inequality.
<br>
THEOREM (Multiplication Property for Inequalities). Multiplying both sides of an inequality by the same positive number produces an equivalent inequality. Multiplying both sides of an inequality by the same negative number and then reversing the inequality sign produces an equivalent inequality. 
Formally, the following three inequalities in x are all equivalent to each other for all real numbers a and all positive numbers m: x &lt; a, mx &lt; ma, −mx &gt; −ma 
Similarly, the following three inequalities in x are all equivalent to each other: x ≤ a, mx ≤ ma, −mx ≥ −ma

 <br><br>
Pure mathematics is the study of the basic concepts and structures that underlie mathematics. Its purpose is to search for a deeper understanding and an expanded knowledge of mathematics itself.
Traditionally, pure mathematics has been classified into three general fields: analysis, which deals with continuous aspects of mathematics; algebra, which deals with discrete aspects; and geometry. The undergraduate program is designed so that students become familiar with each of these areas. Students may also wish to explore other topics such as logic, number theory, complex analysis, and subjects within applied mathematics.
The subject Real Analysis is basic to the program. Since this subject is strongly proof-oriented, some students find it useful to take an intermediate subject such as Linear Algebra or Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning or Linear Algebra, before taking Real Analysis.
The subject Algebra I is more advanced and should not be elected until the student has had some experience with proofs (as in Real Analysis).

<br>You can see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://marshp.github.io/learn-mathematics/index.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://marshp.github.io/learn-mathematics/index.html" target="_blank">these pages online</a> and share this set of files  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/MarshP/learn-mathematics/tree/master/Mathematics" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/MarshP/learn-mathematics/tree/master/Mathematics" target="_blank">on Github</a>
<br>Here's my <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="index" data-href="index" href="\index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Learning Plan</a>
<br><br>I put together this plan and collection of resources because, as an older adult, I realised I was interested in mathematical topics but completely unequipped to understand them.<br>I had never been taught maths properly. My secondary education in the 1980s UK stole all joy from learning maths, so that I struggled through GCSE maths and then dropped the subject.<a href="\#fn-1-b4d0ae4a6bc1002a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">[1]</a> I was in the first year to take GCSEs so that might have been why the teaching was crap for those of us without an initial aptitude.<br>After completing my MSc in computing, now aged 50,  I found there were communities of autodidact maths learners and many great learning <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Resources and materials" data-href="Resources and materials" href="\resources-and-materials.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">resources</a> available free online. I considered taking a maths undergraduate degree, such as the OU's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Example Syllabus - Open University Q31 BSc Mathematics" data-href="Example Syllabus - Open University Q31 BSc Mathematics" href="\3-undergraduate\example-syllabus-open-university-q31-bsc-mathematics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Q31 BSc Mathematics</a> but I had just finished three degrees, one after another, over seventeen years. I wanted a gentle intellectual hobby to progress in my own time; so here we are. Also, even at the OU's reasonable prices, BSc Mathematics would take £20,000 (2023 prices) out of my retirement fund.<br><br>I adopted the <a data-href="U.S Maths education" href="\u.s-maths-education.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">U.S Maths education</a> curriculum for this. It stacks knowledge logically, with somewhat agreed content, all the way from primary to tertiary/undergraduate studies. When I compared it to GCSE and A-Level maths in the UK the latter seemed a mess, with an array of exam boards and a muddled National Curriculum. <br>The UK curriculum seems to prioritise maths for practical daily application, which is laudable in its way, but my daily numeracy is fine; I want to learn mathematics because I enjoy mathematics.<br><br>I value ease of use and portability in my notes. These are plain-text  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://commonmark.org/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://commonmark.org/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> files. I'm using them in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> note taking tool but you should be able to read them in a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">wide variety of tools and formats</a>.<br>Pages are both tagged for Obsidian users, and sorted into folders for everyone else. Creativity might thrive on the free association of files in a flat structure, but learning a subject incrementally demands a more structured approach.<br><br>I'm not preparing this vault for publication or beauty contests. I'll make single pages consistent and readable, buy syntax and typography will be inconsistent across pages; what's a Heading: 2 on one page might be H3 or just bold on another. Sorry.<br><br>For folders it's a way to order folders by education level. For pages it's to put indexes/maps of content alphabetically at the top. I'd usually use an underscore prefix _filename, but that doesn't serve correctly on Github Pages.<br>
<br>0 Primary level, indexes are 0-0 etc.
<br>1 Secondary level, indexes are 1-0 etc.
<br>2 Undergraduate level, indexes are 2-0 etc.
<br>3 Postgraduate level, indexes are 3-0 etc.

 <br><br>There are many, many more resources available to learn maths than are listed here. These are selected, quality, free materials I'm actually using to complete my curriculum.
