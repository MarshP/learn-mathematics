- In 6/3 = 2 parts are dividened/divisor = quotient

### No commutative property
- Division is not commutative like [[Properties of multiplication]] and [[Properties of addition]] are; order matters
 - 6/3 $\neq$ 3/6

### Division with zero
- 0/_n_ is allowed, and gives zero
- _n_/0 is not allowed and always gives undefined

### Division with 1
- When we divide a number by 1, the number will remain unchanged
- _n_/1 = _n_

### Tip: divide using brackets
365/5 = (300/5) + (60/5) + (5/5)
= 60 + 12 + 1
= 73
