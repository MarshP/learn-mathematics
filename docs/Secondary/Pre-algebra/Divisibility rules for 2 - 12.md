Not really sure to what extent these are useful, but here they are. Probably better to look them up as needed for specific problems, apart from some easy ones like 9 , 3, 4

### Divisibility by 2

- A number is divisible by 2 if the number is even. This means the final digit of the number ends with a (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)

### Divisibility by 3

- ==A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the number's digits is divisible by 3==

### Divisibility by 4

- ==A number is divisible by 4 if the final two digits of the number form a number that is divisible by 4==

### Divisibility by 5

- A number is divisible by 5 if the final digit is a 0 or a 5

### Divisibility by 6

- A number is divisible by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3

### Divisibility by 7

- We start by removing the final digit from the number, double the number and subtract it away from the shortened original number
- If the number formed is a 0 or a number that is divisible by 7, the original number is divisible by 7. We can repeat the process as needed

### Divisibility by 8

- A number is divisible by 8 if the final three digits of the number form a number that is divisible by 8

### Divisibility by 9

- ==A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of the number's digits is divisible by 9==

### Divisibility by 10

- A number is divisible by 10 if the final digit is a 0

### Divisibility by 11

- Form the sum of the digits in the odd places and subtract away the sum of the digits in the even places
- The odd places refer to the 1st digit, 3rd digit, 5th digit, and so on
- The even places refer to the 2nd digit, 4th digit, 6th digit, and so on
- Note, we can count our digits starting from right to left or left to right. This can result in a sign difference, which is not important.
- If the result is a 0 or a number that is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11

### Divisibility by 12

- A number is divisible by 12 if the number is divisible by both 3 and 4
