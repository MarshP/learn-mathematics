1. Find the [[Prime factorisation example|prime factorization]] for each number
2. Create a list of prime factors that are common to all numbers
3. The GCF is the product of the numbers on the list
4. Optional - it can be helpful to organize information in a table format


**Example**

- 40 and 60
- 40 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 5
- 60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
- In common = 5 and two of the 2s (discard the unmatched 2)
- 2 x 2 x 5 = GCF 20
