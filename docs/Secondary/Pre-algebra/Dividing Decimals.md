It's all basically [[Long division]] and getting the d.p back in.

### Dividing a Decimal by a Whole Number

- Set up the long division normally
- Place the decimal point from the dividend directly above into the answer
- Divide normally

### Decimals and Remainders in Long Division

Place enough zeros after the decimal point and continuing the division. Recall that 13, 13.0, 13.00, and 13.000Â are all the same value. We continue to add zeros until we have no remainder. In some cases, we will stop when we see a repeating digit or series of digits.

### Dividing by a Decimal

When we divide by a decimal, we move the decimal point in the divisor by enough places to the right such that it becomes a whole number. We then match this movement in our dividend.
