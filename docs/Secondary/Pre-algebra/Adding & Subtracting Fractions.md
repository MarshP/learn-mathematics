### With common denominator (easy)

$$
{3 \over 8} + {1 \over 8} = {4 \over 8} = {1 \over 2}
$$



### No common denominator

- Find the LCD - this is the [[Finding the Least Common Multiple|LCM]] of all denominators
- Transform each fraction into an equivalent fraction where the LCD is its denominator
- Perform the indicated operation (addition or subtraction) with the numerators only
- Place the result over the common denominator
- Simplify the fraction

$$
{5 \over 6} + {3 \over 10} = {25 \over 30} + {9 \over 30} = {34 \over 30} = 1 {4 \over 30} = 1 {2 \over 15} 
$$

$$
{2 \over 21} + {14 \over 15} - {9 \over 10} = {20 \over 210} + {196 \over 210} - {189 \over 210} = {20 \over 210} + {196 \over 210} - {189 \over 210} = {27 \over 210} = {9 \over 70}
$$
