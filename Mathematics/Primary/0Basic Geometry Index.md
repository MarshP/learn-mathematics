### Quadrilaterals review

- Review the following quadrilaterals: parallelogram, trapezoid, rhombus, rectangle, and square. Â Then, try some practice problems.

### Transformations

- Rigid transforms: rotation, translation, reflection  
- Write the shape and its translation using prime symbol ' [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)
- Three pieces of information are needed to rotate a shape:  
  - the centre of rotation  
  - the angle of rotation  
  - the direction of rotation  

- In reflection A to A' will be perpendicular to line of reflection. To describe a reflection on a grid, the equation of the mirror line is needed. E.g reflect in X= -1  

- Column vectors are used to describe translations. 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x&change\\  
y&change  
\end{pmatrix}
$$  
- Two pieces of information are needed to enlarge a shape:  
  - the scale factor  
  - the centre of enlargement - can be outside shape  
 
- Congruent shape are same size and shape. One can cover the other via rigid transforms. Can include reflection.  
  - Triangle congruent tests: SSS SAS ASA RHS  

- Similar shapes need rigid and non rigid transforms to cover each other.
  - Similar have corresponding angles the same,  and corresponding sides same scale factor.  
  - Two triangles are similar if the angles are the same size or the corresponding sides are in the same ratio. Either of these conditions will prove two triangles are similar.  

### Triangle inequality (lengths)

- A side of a triangle must be:
  - Shorter than the sum of the other sides
  - Longer than the difference between the other two sides
