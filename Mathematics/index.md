## Learning Plan

- Based on [[U.S Maths Education]], for [[About this Vault|reasons]].
- Links lead to my sources and notes.

### Primary
1.  [[Arithmetic]]
2.  [[Basic Geometry]]
### Secondary
3.  [[Pre-algebra]]
4.  [[Algebra I]]

## Future subjects
### Secondary (cont.)
5. Geometry
6. Algebra II
7. Precalculus

### Tertiary/undergraduate 
8. Single-variable calculus
9. Multivariable calculus
10. Linear algebra
11. Complex variables
12. Ordinary differential equations
13. Partial differential equations

### Undergraduate mathematics specialism
- Abstract algebra
- Number theory
- Real analysis  
- Advanced calculus
- Complex analysis
- Probability theory
- Statistics

### Further study
By now you'll know enough to choose what specialisms interest you. Some likely useful starters are:
- Set theory
- Mathematical logic
