# Start Here

- Read [[About this Vault]] and the chosen learning path
- See what [[Resources and Materials]] I'm using to learn mathematics for free
- Based on [[U.S Maths Education]], for [[About this Vault|reasons]].
- Links lead to my sources and notes.

## Learning Plan

- [[Sticking Points to Revisit]]
### Primary
1.  [[0-Arithmetic Index-0]] 
2.  [[0-Basic Geometry Index-0]]
### Secondary
3.  [[0-Pre-algebra Index-0]]
4.  [[0-Algebra I Index-0]] **<--- I'm currently here**

## Future subjects
### Secondary (cont.)
5. Geometry
6. Algebra II
7. Precalculus **<--- My 2024 goal**

### Tertiary/undergraduate 
8. Single-variable calculus
9. Multivariable calculus
10. Linear algebra
11. Complex variables
12. Ordinary differential equations
13. Partial differential equations

### Undergraduate mathematics specialism
- Abstract algebra
- Number theory
- Real analysis  
- Advanced calculus
- Complex analysis
- Probability theory
- Statistics

### Further study
By now you'll know enough to choose what specialisms interest you. Some likely useful starters are:
- Set theory
- Mathematical logic
