# Start Here

- Read [[About this Vault]] and the chosen learning path
- See what [[Resources and Materials]] I'm using to learn mathematics for free
- Based on [[U.S Maths Education]], for [[About this Vault|reasons]].
- Links lead to my sources and notes.

## Learning Plan
### Primary
1.  [[_Arithmetic Index]] 
2.  [[_Basic Geometry Index]]
### Secondary
3.  [[_Pre-algebra Index]]
4.  [[_Algebra I Index]] <--- I'm currently here

## Future subjects
### Secondary (cont.)
5. Geometry
6. Algebra II
7. Precalculus

### Tertiary/undergraduate 
8. Single-variable calculus
9. Multivariable calculus
10. Linear algebra
11. Complex variables
12. Ordinary differential equations
13. Partial differential equations

### Undergraduate mathematics specialism
- Abstract algebra
- Number theory
- Real analysis  
- Advanced calculus
- Complex analysis
- Probability theory
- Statistics

### Further study
By now you'll know enough to choose what specialisms interest you. Some likely useful starters are:
- Set theory
- Mathematical logic
