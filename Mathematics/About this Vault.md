## Hi, I'm Marsh

I put together this plan and collection of resources because, as an older adult, I realised I was interested in mathematical topics but completely unequipped to understand them.

I had never been taught maths properly. My secondary education in the 1980s UK stole all joy from learning maths, so that I struggled through GCSE maths and then dropped the subject.[^1] I was in the first year to take GCSEs so that might have been why the teaching was crap for those of us without an initial aptitude.

After completing my MSc in computing, now aged 50,  I found there were communities of autodidact maths learners and many great learning [[Resources and Materials|resources]] available free online. I considered taking a maths undergraduate degree, such as the OU's *Q31 BSc Mathematics* but I had just finished three degrees, one after another, over seventeen years. I wanted a gentle intellectual hobby to progress in my own time; so here we are.  

## Curriculum Choice

I adopted the [[U.S Maths Education]] curriculum for this. It stacks knowledge logically, with somewhat agreed content, all the way from primary to tertiary/undergraduate studies. When I compared it to GCSE and A-Level maths in the UK the latter seemed a mess, with an array of exam boards and a muddled National Curriculum.

## Markdown for Obsidian

I value ease of use and portability in my notes. These are plain-text  [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) files. I'm using them in the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note taking tool but you should be able to read them in a [wide variety of tools and formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Pages are both tagged for Obsidian users, and sorted into folders for everyone else. Creativity might thrive on the free association of files in a flat structure, but learning a subject incrementally demands a more structured approach.

## Typographic Unconventions

I'm not preparing this vault for publication or beauty contests. I'll make single pages consistent and readable, buy syntax and typography will be inconsistent across pages; what's a Heading: 2 on one page might be H3 or just bold on another. Sorry.
