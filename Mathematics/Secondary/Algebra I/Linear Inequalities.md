## Learning Checklist

> A linear inequality is an inequality relation applied to two linear expressions. There are four types of linear inequalities corresponding to the four types of inequality relations: 
> x < y, x > y, x ≼ y, and x ≽ y.
> 
> We say that a number is a solution for the given inequality in variable x if substituting that number for x makes the inequality true. The collection of all such numbers forms the solution set for the inequality.


> (Interval Notation). The interval notation (a, b) describes the set of all real numbers between a and b. When we want to include the endpoints, we use square brackets: \[a, b\]. When we want the interval to extend indefinitely, we use the infinity sign: (a, ∞).
