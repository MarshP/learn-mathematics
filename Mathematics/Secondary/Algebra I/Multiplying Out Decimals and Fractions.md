# Multiplying Out Decimals and Fractions 

- Pen and paper noted just repeat exactly what's below so no link needed.

## Learning checklist

- When multiplying away decimals, no need to multiply what's in the brackets, only the bracket multiplier
- For fractions find the LCD of *all* fractions. Multiply by that.
- If the numbers seem too big, did you miss simplifying a fraction?


**Correct:**
0.5(7+7) = 7
5(7+7) = 70
35+35 = 70

**NOT:**
0.5(7+7) = 7
5(70+70) = 70 
350+350 = 70
