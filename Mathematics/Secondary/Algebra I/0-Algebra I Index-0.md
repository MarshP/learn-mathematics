> These concepts are fundamental to success in higher math classes such as Algebra II, Geometry, and Calculus. We will start by learning about variables and expressions, then move on to learn about: solving linear equations in one variable, graphing linear equations in two variables, systems of linear equations, operations with polynomials, factoring polynomials, rational expressions, roots, and solving quadratic equations.
