## Learning Checklist

- Solve linear inequalities in one variable
  - Remember when to reverse the inequality (mult or divide by same negative number)
- Test solutions (above and below range)
- Write solutions in range notation
- Graph solutions on number line

> A linear inequality is an inequality relation applied to two linear expressions. There are four types of linear inequalities corresponding to the four types of inequality relations: 
> x < y, x > y, x ≼ y, and x ≽ y.
> 
> We say that a number is a solution for the given inequality in variable x if substituting that number for x makes the inequality true. The collection of all such numbers forms the solution set for the inequality.


> (Interval Notation). The interval notation (a, b) describes the set of all real numbers between a and b. When we want to include the endpoints, we use square brackets: \[a, b\]. When we want the interval to extend indefinitely, we use the infinity sign: (a, ∞).

> Inequalities are equivalent if they have the same solution sets. 

> THEOREM (Addition Property for Inequalities). Adding the same number on both sides of an inequality produces an equivalent inequality.

> THEOREM (Multiplication Property for Inequalities). Multiplying both sides of an inequality by the same positive number produces an equivalent inequality. **Multiplying both sides of an inequality by the same negative number and then reversing the inequality sign produces an equivalent inequality.** 
> 
> Formally, the following three inequalities in x are all equivalent to each other for all real numbers a and all positive numbers m: x < a, mx < ma, −mx > −ma 
> 
> Similarly, the following three inequalities in x are all equivalent to each other: x ≤ a, mx ≤ ma, −mx ≥ −ma
