## Learning checklist

- We call an equation linear if every term is either a constant or a product of a constant and the first power of a single variable.
- Why we don't use x as the sign for multiplication; what we do instead; **dots, parentheses, proximity**.
- Define **term** (a constant, or a variable and coefficient) and **expression** (terms separated by + or -)
- Explain the various **coefficients** in for example `4xy` (4 is c of xy; 4x is c of y; x is c of 4y )
- Define **like terms** (same variable raised to the same power)
- **Combine like terms** by keeping variables the same and performing operations on coefficients
- **Simplify an expression** by **removing parentheses** and **combining like terms**
- Define **equation** (a statement two algebraic expressions are equal; always includes the = symbol)
- **Test a solution** for a variable in an equation by simple substitution (plug it in, see if it gives true result)
- Understand the **addition property of equality** (we can add or subtract a value from both sides of an equation without changing the solution)
  - **Additive inverse property** any number plus its negative is zero
  - **Additive identity zero** any number plus zero is unchanged.
- In a simple equation solvable by addition and subtraction, **isolate a variable by inverse operations** (add or subtract from both sides until you get x = number)
-  Understand the **multiplicative property of equality** (we can mult or div both sides by a non-zero value without changing the solution)
  - **Multiplicative identity property of 1** any number x1 is unchanged
  - **Multiplicative invers property** any non-zero number, expressed as fraction, x its reciprocal, is 1
- In a simple equation solvable by mult and div, **isolate a variable by inverse operations**
- **Solve linear equations** in one variable with a 4 step process.
- Spot **conditional** (normal solvable, inc. 1y = 0), **identity** (0y = 0 **but not** 1y = 0; solution is any real number {ℝ} ) and **contradiction** (no solution is true {∅} ) equations.
- Define **ratio, rate and proportion**.
- ! I dunno about this. More usually seems to need simplification with LCD!  Solve **proportion equations** by starting with cross multiplication then the four steps.

## Solve linear equations in one variable

> [!success]+
> This is a rubicon. It's the precise moment school maths left me behind, and I had no idea what was going on from here to the GCSE exams. Doing this _and enjoying it_ brought a tear to my eye.

Four*ish* step process:

  - If it's a word or application problem, find what is being asked and assign the unknown quantity a variable.
  - If it's a proportion equation, one fraction each side, cross multiply.
1. Simplify both sides so far as possible
  - Remove brackets by [[Properties of multiplication|distributive property of multiplication]]
  - When we encounter an equation with fractions and parentheses are involved, we want to remove parentheses before we clear our fractions
  - `Q: decimals clear before or after brackets?`
  - Collect like terms
2. Isolate the variable term(s) on one side, usually left, using addition/subtraction (addition property of equality, additive inverse property)
3. Isolate the variable using multiplication and division
4. Check the answer by substituting the variable in the original equation. **This matters it's where you may find div by zero etc. contradictions.**

**Example**

$$
\displaylines{
{5(1 - 5x) = 2( -6x -4)} \newline
{5-25x = -12x-8} \newline
{5-25x + 12x = -8} \newline
{5-13x = -8} \newline
{-13x = -8-5} \newline
{-13x = -13} \newline
{{-13\over-13}x = {-13\over-13}} \newline
{{1}x = {1}} \newline
}
$$

### 1 - Properties of equations

> A number is called a solution for the equation involving one variable if substituting this number for the variable makes the equation true. The set of all solutions for the equation is called its solution set. To solve the equation means to find its solution set.

> Equations are equivalent if they have the same solutions sets.

### 2 - Solving linear equations

> A linear equation is an equation in which each term is either a numerical constant or the product of a numerical constant and the first power of a single variable.

> If the equation looks like 0 = 4 or something equally wrong, then it is false for all x. There are no solutions: the set of solutions is empty, or ∅. 
> 
> If the equation looks like 0 = 0, then it is true for all x. Every real number is a solution: the set of solutions is the set of all reals, or ℝ.

### 3 - Linear formulas

> While the word formula has no traditional formal definition, this will be our word of choice for equations in more than one variable.

> We say that a formula involving a variable y is solved for y if it is written in the form y = expression where one side of the equation is just y, and the expression on the other side does not contain y at all.
