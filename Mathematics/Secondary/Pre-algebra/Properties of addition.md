- In 4 + 5 = 9, 4 & 5 are addends, 9 is sum
### Identity property of zero

- Adding zero to any number leaves it unchanged
- 5 + 0 = 5

### The Commutative Property of addition

- The commutative property allows us to reorder the addends in an addition problem.
- 4+5 = 5 + 4

### The Associative Property of addition

- The associative property of addition allows us to regroup three or more addends in an addition problem. The associative property of addition tells us that the addition of three or more numbers can be grouped in any order, without changing the sum.
- 5 + (4+6) = (4+5) + 6
