- Multiplication is repeated addition
- In 4 x 3 = 12, 4 & 3 are factors, 12 is product

### commutative property of multiplication

- Like [[Properties of addition]] the commutative property of multiplication states that we can multiply two or more numbers in any order without changing the product.
- 6 x 5 = 5 x 6

### associative property of multiplication

- Like [[Properties of addition]] the associative property of multiplication states that we can group the multiplication of three or more factors in any order and not change the product.
- 6 x (3x2) = (6x2) x 3

### identity property of 1

- The identity property of 1 states that any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.
- 15 x 1 = 15

### multiplication property of 0

- The multiplication property of 0 states that the product of zero and any number is 0.
- 15 x 0 = 0

### distributive property of multiplication

- 5 x (3+2) = (5x3) + (5x2)  = 5x3 + 5x2 
  - Note order of operations matters here.
