- If we are working with a negative number raised to a power, the base does not include the negative part unless we use parentheses
  -  -22 ≠ (-2)$^2$
- -2$^2$ is the same as -1 x 2$^2$  so from the order of operations...
  - -2$^2$ = -1 x 2$^2$ = -1 x 4 = -4
- (-2)$^2$ has the negative in the base
  - (-2)$^2$  = (1 x -2)$^2$  = -2 x -2 = 4

### Sign rules for evaluating an exponent with a negative base

- When the base is (-), and enclosed inside of parentheses:
  - The result is (+) if the exponent is even
  - The result is (-) if the exponent is odd
- When the base is (-), and not enclosed inside of parentheses:
  - The result is always (-)
